# v0.6

- updated EasyMDE and markdownIt versions used to the latest ones.

# v0.5

- renamed module to ``MEME - Moerills expandable markdown editor``
- Added the markdown parser, and both Editor classes to the ``MEME`` window object, so other modules can invoke the editor themself. (To my knowledge webpack sadly doesn't allow for esm6 module export bundling..)
- removed PluginManager in favor of more hooks for more  flexibility
- all available Hooks:
  - ``MemeRenderEditor(editor, parent)`` - modify the editor after its already been rendered (for both chat and base meme)
  - ``MemeActivateEditor(options)`` - modify the editors options before its invoked
  - ``MemeActivateChat(options)`` - modify the chat editors options before its invoked
- script is now loaded as "script", cause webpack can't even export esm6 modules, to my knowledge...
- fixed error when saving editor.

# v0.4.2

- Fix HTML not parsing

# v0.4.1

- Fixed small issue with the plugin manager not breaking everything if quick insert is not installed/activated.

# v0.4.0

In my opinion this module is now feature complete and is now officially released!  

- Removed entity autocompletion, in favor of proper integration of @Sunspots [Quick Insert](https://gitlab.com/fvtt-modules-lab/quick-insert/) module! (You have to manually install the quick insert module, but it should work out of the box together with MEME)
- Improved and added compatibility with so many mods! Should be compatible with most modules now!
  - Added compatibility with [Foriens Quest Log](https://github.com/Forien/foundryvtt-forien-quest-log/)
  - [Emojule](https://github.com/Moerill/emojule/) support!
  - [Quick Insert](https://gitlab.com/fvtt-modules-lab/quick-insert/) 
- Restructured the whole code for better maintainability and extensibility
  - Added a PluginManager to allow for other modules to enhance MEMEs features. (Documentation still missing, take a look at the quick-insert integration as example)
- Switched renderer to use [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) instead of marked for easier and better extensibility
- Created a settings menu with some basic information and toggles for:
  - chat markdown support
  - rich text editor markdown support
- Removed the welcome screen popup by popular request. All the important information will now be shown in the settings menu. You now need to check the Changelog linked there yourself!
- When starting to edit the view will jump to the end of the document. (I decided to do this, since imo more often one wants to add stuff to the end instead of the beginning.)
- *FIX* dropped entity links not appearing at the shown position
- *FIX* entity links and not being rendered properly in some non MEME places
- *FIX* some visual bugs caused in tidy 5e sheet and some other places.
